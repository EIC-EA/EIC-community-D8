# Sidebar filter

Displays the filter sidebar composition that should be used within a overview page.
Filters will be grouped if more than 1 filter exists within the `items[]items` object of the initial item `entry`.
A filter group will be expandable if more than 5 filters are defined within a group.

The sidebar can also expand and collapse for smaller viewports.
